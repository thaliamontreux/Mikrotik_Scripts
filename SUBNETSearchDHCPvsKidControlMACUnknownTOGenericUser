#This Script searches DHCP Leases and searches for machines with a ip address specified by "Target Subnet" variable and
#if they are not added to the kid control feature it will auto add the device. You can set this script to run every 10 minutes
#or even sooner sequential runs. I run this script every 2 minutes. This prevents devices with the random mac address feature
#from circumventing security and forcing them to turn it off. 
#
# Define the target subnet
:local targetSubnet "192.168.99.0/24";

# Iterate through all DHCP leases
:foreach lease in=[/ip dhcp-server lease find] do={

    # Get the IP address of the current lease
    :local ip [/ip dhcp-server lease get $lease address];

    # Check if the IP falls within the target subnet
    :if ($ip in $targetSubnet) do={

        # Fetch additional details
        :local mac [/ip dhcp-server lease get $lease mac-address];
        :local hostName [/ip dhcp-server lease get $lease host-name];

        # Check if the device's MAC address is assigned to a Kid-Control user
        :local assignedUser [/ip kid-control device find mac-address=$mac];
        
        # Log the device details and Kid-Control assignment status
        :if ([:len $assignedUser] > 0) do={
            #:log info "Device in $targetSubnet: IP=$ip, MAC=$mac, Hostname=$hostName, Assigned to Kid-Control user.";
        } else={
